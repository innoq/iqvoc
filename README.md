# iQvoc

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/iqvoc.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/iqvoc)
![CI](https://github.com/innoq/iqvoc/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/innoq/iqvoc.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/innoq/iqvoc)

iQvoc is a vocabulary management tool that combines easy-to-use human interfaces
with Semantic Web interoperability.

iQvoc supports vocabularies that are common to many knowledge organization
systems, such as:

* Thesauri
* Taxonomies
* Classification schemes
* Subject heading systems

iQvoc provides comprehensive functionality for all aspects of managing such
vocabularies:

* import of existing vocabularies from a SKOS representation
* multilingual display and navigation in any Web browser
* editorial features for registered users
* publishing the vocabulary in the Semantic Web

iQvoc is built with state-of-the-art technology and can be easily customized according to user's needs.

## Demo

You can try out iQvoc right now! In our [sandbox](http://try.iqvoc.net/) you can play around with the public views.
If you like to test the collaborative functions simply [request](mailto:iqvoc@innoq.com) your personal demo account.

## Setup

### Heroku

You can easily setup your iQvoc instance in under 5 minutes, we wanted to make
this process really easy. In order to deploy to heroku you need to have an
account and [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com) installed.

```
$ bundle install
$ heroku create
$ heroku config:add HEROKU=true RAILS_ENV=heroku RACK_ENV=heroku SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(bundle exec rake secret)
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
$ heroku run rake db:seed
$ heroku restart
```

`heroku open` opens your app in the browser.

Remember to visit the Users section and change the default passwords!

### Docker

If you want to try iQvoc using Docker just clone this repository and run:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

This Setup uses Postgres as a database. Please make sure that your Docker daemon is running and that you have docker-compose installed. User credentials can be found in https://github.com/innoq/iqvoc/blob/master/db/seeds.rb.

### Custom

We recommend running [iQvoc as a Rails engine](https://github.com/innoq/iqvoc/wiki/iQvoc-as-a-Rails-Engine).
Running the cloned source code is possible but any modifications would require a
fork.

1. Configure your database via `config/database.template.yml`.
   Don't forget to rename it to `database.yml`
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `bundle exec rake db:create` to create the database
4. Create the necessary tables by running `rake db:migrate`
5. Load some base data by running `rake db:seed`
6. Make sure you have got `config/secrets.yml` in place
7. Install nodejs dependencies for compiling assets: `npm install` (make sure nodejs is installed)
8. Compile assets using: `npm run compile` (or `npm run watch` to compile and listen for changes in development)
8. Boot up the app using `bundle exec rails s` (or `passenger start` if you use passenger)
9. Log in with "admin@iqvoc" / "admin123" or "demo@iqvoc" / "cooluri123" (cf. step #5)
10. Visit the Users section and change the default passwords

## Background Jobs

Note that some features like "Import" and "Export" exposed in the Web UI store
their workload as jobs. You can either issue a job worker that runs continuously
and watches for new jobs via

```
$ rake jobs:work
```

or process jobs in a one-off way (in development or via cron):

```
$ rake jobs:workoff
```

## Compatibility

iQvoc is fully compatible with Ruby 2.6.

## Customization

There are many hooks providing support for your own classes and configuration.
The core app also works as a Rails Engine. The config residing in `lib/iqvoc.rb`
provides a basic overview of the possibilities.

## Documentation

Documentation resources can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/innoq/iqvoc/wiki).

iQvoc provides an (inline) API documentation which can be found on `APP_URI/apidoc`. Check out our sandbox to see it in action: http://try.iqvoc.net/apidoc/
