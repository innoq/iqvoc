class Concept::Relation::Base < ActiveRecord::Base

  # ATTENTION:
  # This class (and the inheriting subclasses) should not reference the
  # Concept::Base class directly at load time!
  # This means that Concept::Base may not be loaded when this class is loaded!
  # So use Concept::Base ONLY in methods or procs.
  #
  # The reason for this lies in the fact that Concept::Base calls the
  # Concept::Relation::SKOS::Broader::Base.narrower_class method to create all
  # concept_relation relations. This means Concept::Base triggers Rails to load
  # the Concept::Relation::* classes. If this would trigger Rails to load
  # Concept::Base we would have a loop == a problem.
