# ATTENTION:
# This class (and the inheriting subclasses) should not reference the
# Concept::Base class directly at load time!
# This means that Concept::Base may not be loaded when this class is loaded!
# So use Concept::Base ONLY in methods or procs.
#
# The reason for this lies in the fact that Concept::Base calls the
# Concept::Relation::SKOS::Broader::Base.narrower_class method to create all
# concept_relation relations. This means Concept::Base triggers Rails to load
# the Concept::Relation::* classes. If this would trigger Rails to load
# Concept::Base we would have a loop == a problem.
